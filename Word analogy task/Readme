"a is to b as c is to __".

An example is:
'man is to woman as king is to queen' .

We are trying to find a word d, such that the associated word vectors  ea,eb,ec,edea,eb,ec,ed  are related in the following manner:
eb−ea≈ed−eceb−ea≈ed−ec 
We will measure the similarity between  eb−eaeb−ea  and  ed−eced−ec  using cosine similarity.
