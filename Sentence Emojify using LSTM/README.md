# Sentence Emojify using LSTM

Have you ever wanted to make your text messages more expressive? Your emojifier app will help you do that. So rather than writing:

"Congratulations on the promotion! Let's get coffee and talk. Love you!"

The emojifier can automatically turn this into:

"Congratulations on the promotion! üëç Let's get coffee and talk. ‚òïÔ∏è Love you! ‚ù§Ô∏è"

You will implement a model which inputs a sentence (such as "Let's go see the baseball game tonight!") and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with this sentence (‚öæÔ∏è).

### Examples of Output:

i adore you ‚ù§Ô∏è

i love you ‚ù§Ô∏è

funny lol üòÑ

lets play with a ball ‚öæ

food is ready üç¥

### 2.1 - Overview of the model

Here is the Emojifier-v2 you will implement:

#### Inputs and outputs to the embedding layer

* The `Embedding()` layer's input is an integer matrix of size **(batch size, max input length)**. 
    * This input corresponds to sentences converted into lists of indices (integers).
    * The largest integer (the highest word index) in the input should be no larger than the vocabulary size.
* The embedding layer outputs an array of shape (batch size, max input length, dimension of word vectors).

* The figure shows the propagation of two example sentences through the embedding layer. 
    * Both examples have been zero-padded to a length of `max_len=5`.
    * The word embeddings are 50 units in length.
    * The final dimension of the representation is  `(2,max_len,50)`.
